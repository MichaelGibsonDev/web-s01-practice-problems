  <h1>Practice Problems Webpage</h1>

  <p>This practice problem set, and many more to come, is only concerned with Javascript code. Thus, no new HTML
    elements will be displayed in the browser. Instead, your code is expected to appear in the "console" of the browser.
    Replit has a console that you can access by clicking the small wrench icon towards the top-right corner of the
    Replit browser. After clicking the wrench, a dark screen should open up below the browser and the console tab should
    already be selected.</p>
  <script>
    /*
    DIRECTIONS: Just like Chrome, Replit has a console that you can access by clicking the small wrench icon towards the top-right corner of the Replit browser.  Remember that you might need to hit "Run" above to automatically open up the browser window.  After clicking the wrench, a dark screen should open up below the browser and the console tab should already be selected.
    */

    /*
    PROBLEM 1: Introduce yourself to the console by logging a greeting and stating your name below.  Just like in HTML, you can erase the comment "ENTER YOUR CODE HERE" and replace it with your own code.
    */
    //ENTER YOUR CODE HERE

    /*
    PROBLEM 2: Log to the console your favorite number. With numbers, you do not include quotations marks in console.log()
    */
    //ENTER YOUR CODE HERE

    /*
    PROBLEM 3: Log to the console the sentence: "I am logging the word 'log' while sitting on a log"
    */
    //ENTER YOUR CODE HERE

    /*
    PROBLEM 4: Log to the console whether you are ready or not for the next learning objective.
    */
    //ENTER YOUR CODE HERE
