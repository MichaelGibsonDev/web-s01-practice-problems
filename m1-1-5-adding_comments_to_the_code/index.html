  <!--
    DIRECTIONS: In these practice problems, we will practice writing comments both in HTML and Javascript.  Please note that there is a different syntax to writting comments in each.

  <!--
    PROBLEM 1: Write a comment below that reminds you to add some content about your hometown here:
  -->
  <!--Write content about my hometown-->
  <!--
    PROBLEM 2: Write a comment that adds your name to the following list, but does not actually show up in the browser:
  -->
  <ul>List of Scrooge's nephews:
    <li>Huey</li>
    <li>Dewey</li>
    <li>Louie</li>
    <li><!--Michael Goes Here-->></li>
  </ul>

  <script>
    /*
    PROBLEM 3: Add a Javascript comment below that tells us your favorite food
    /*
    //My Favorite food is Chicken
    /*
    PROBLEM 4: Comment out the following log, so that it doesn't get printed to the console, but it still remains here:
    */
    //console.log("Make sure I don't print to the console.")

    
    //PROBLEM 5: Log the math problem 5 + 3 to the console and add an answer that is commented out on the same line next to it.
    let math1 = 5;
    let math2 = 3;
    const mathing = (math1 + math2);
    console.log(mathing); //The answer is 8
