  <!--
    DIRECTIONS: These practice problems are all about getting used to the console's ability to report errors, both in HTML and Javascript code.
      -->

  <!--
  PROBLEM 1: The following HTML code works fine.  Try erasing one of the arrows, "<" or ">", surrounding the first "p" below and see what changes in the browser.  Don't foget to click "Run".  Most code editors will display an error, but Replit tries to make sense of the code anyway. Describe what malfunctions as a result of the error.  Enter your description in the space below.
  -->
  <p style="border: 2px solid blue">
    What happens as a result of erasing one HTML arrow?
    <!--ENTER YOUR CODE HERE-->
  </p>

  <!--
  PROBLEM 2: The following HTML code works fine.  Now try erasing the slash just before the second "p" below and see what changes in the browser.
  -->
  <p style="border: 2px solid green">
    What happens as a result of erasing the slash before the closing "p"?
    <!--ENTER YOUR CODE HERE-->
  </p>
  <!--Although this error will be flagged in a typical code editor (like VSCode), here in Replit, this error is a good example of one that might not have any effect on the code's output.-->
  <p>All your remaining solutions for this set of practice problems are located in the Replit console. Please open the
    console by clicking the wrench icon near the top-right corner of this browser.</p>

    /*
    PROBLEM 3: The following Javascript code works fine.  Try erasing the period after "console" and note the error that follows.  Log the error in the space below after fixing it so the code runs as normal.
    */
    console.log("ENTER YOUR CODE HERE")

    /*
    PROBLEM 4: The following Javascript code works fine.  Try capitalizing the word Log in "console.log()".  Log the error type in the space below after fixing it so the code runs as normal.
    */
    console.log("ENTER YOUR CODE HERE")

    /*
    PROBLEM 5 (DEBUGGING): The following Javascript code has an error.  Uncomment the code to see the error pop up in the console, then try to find the error and fix it.
    */
    //consloe.log("Why am I not printing?")
